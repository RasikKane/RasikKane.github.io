 Engineering is switching.<br />
 I learned it from Transistors.

I enjoyed public speaking and connecting with peoples. 'Internet of *Things*' gave me joy of doing the same with the micro-computers and devices.
I remember Sherlock Holmes saying - *Data Data Data... I need DATA*. Same is true with IoT. I decided to focus on data analytics to understand how insights are drawn from the the whole Networks of data sources A.K.A. "OUR ENTIRE WORLD" and use it for Wise business decisions, Energy efficient buildings, Good Linkedin feeds and what not. 
Currently, I'm working towards analysing and predicting data from *things* (aka Machine Learning).

I enjoy reading History and trekking. I have authored a couple of one act plays in Marathi and love to read good plays.
